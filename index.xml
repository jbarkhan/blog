&lt;p>I have been thinking lately about detection engineering. Specifically, I have been thinking about these two questions as they relate to a detection engineering program:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>What matters?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can you measure success?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I am not sure I have a good answer to either of these questions yet and there isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of authoritative information out there. As far as I can tell, detection engineering is a somewhat specialised and relatively new field within cyber security. It seems like most organisations are doing their own thing and only sufficiently mature organisations appear to have dedicated detection engineering teams.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>whoami</title><link>https://nullthought.dev/whoami/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 18:46:21 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://nullthought.dev/whoami/</guid><description>&lt;p>My name is Jerome. I work in a blue team doing detection and response. I use this space to think out loud-quietly. I vibe coded this website and have no idea how it works.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
